Hello, thanks for checking out my **Content Creator** web app, built using **TypeScript and React**.

## Tech Stack

- **Styling:** Tailwind
- **Tooling:** [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- **Testing:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/nickmaddren/nicks-content-creator.git

```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173/` (default Vite port and spells "site" ðŸ¤“).

```

## TO-DOs

- **Test edge cases:** The E2E test covers the critical flow, however, it would be beneficial to create some component tests that cover edge cases.
- **Additional error handling**
- **Responsiveness:** The experience for tablet and mobile could be improved.
- **Dimensions warning:** When the user types a dimension outside the clamp limit we should warn them.
